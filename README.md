# Bioinformatics-in-Action-Part_3

**Bioinformatics in Action**

One application of bioinformatics is in the use of whole-genome sequencing for clinical microbiology diagnostics. Bacteria from an infection can be isolated and sequenced. The genomic data can then be queried for specific features in order to guide the most effective treatment. These features include antibiotic resistance genes, as well as markers that identify which species the bacterial isolate belongs to. This information can then be used to inform the most appropriate antibiotic(s) for treating the infection.

In this project, you will be given whole-genome sequencing data from several bacterial infections. Your job is to determine which bacterial species is responsible for each infection and which antibiotics could be used for treatment.

**Bioinformatics in Action** assessment consists of **three parts**:

- **Part 1:** Group oral presentation

- **Part 2:** Group peer feedback

- **Part 3**: Individual short report

**Bioinformatics in Action: Part 3 Individual Short Report (400-500 words)**

You will be given **one additional dataset** to analyse individually. These **individual** datasets will be different for each student.
You should repeat the steps you used in your group analysis on your individual dataset, and then write a report based on your individual results.

The report should include the following **headings**:

- **Introduction**In this section you should provide relevant background on the research area and define the research question to be answered.

- **Methods**In this section you should describe the analysis steps. For each step, please specify the code that you ran, and explain what each command is doing.

- **Results**In this section you should summarise the important features of the outputs produced from your analysis steps.

- This may include images (e.g. screenshots from your RStudio terminal or screenshots from IGV) not counted towards the word limit.
Remember that some of your output files may be very large. If so, you should focus on presenting the information that is needed to form your conclusions. You do ***not*** need to include the whole output files in your report. Screenshots showing the relevant sections are fine. Part of the challenge here is in learning how to **be concise** and only present the aspects of your result files that are relevant to the research question you are addressing.

- **Conclusions**In this section you should briefly summarise your overall findings in the context of the research question being addressed.

Note: This is an **individual** assessment. Make sure you do not breach the Academic Integrity Policy.

**Weighting**: 20%
**Due**: 03/12/2024, 10:00pm.
